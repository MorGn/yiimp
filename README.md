### Welcome to the cryptopool.builders github!
### This fork of YiiMP is designed to work with our Ultimate Crypto-Server Installer program.
Trying to install this on a server not built by our installer will cause headaches, frustrations, and screaming loudly at your monitor.

#### Please go to https://github.com/MorGn/Multi-Pool-Installer for our installer.

## Changes to this fork include but not limited to:

```
- File structure -
$STORAGE_ROOT/yiimp/site/web
$STORAGE_ROOT/yiimp/site/stratum (Only on single server installs)
$STORAGE_ROOT/yiimp/site/configuration
$STORAGE_ROOT/yiimp/site/crons
$STORAGE_ROOT/yiimp/site/log
$STORAGE_ROOT/yiimp/starts

- Site Files-
Updated various files to work with new file structure
```
